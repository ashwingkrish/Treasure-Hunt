# Treasure Hunt App for Vibrations 2k17


This is an Android application that I built for Dayanada Sagar College of Engineering's fest, called Vibrations.


All the images and the answers in the application are encoded, so nobody could cheat by just looking at the strings.xml file.


The game was to find bar codes that were scattered around the college based on the picture displayed, and to scan that bar code to
proceed to the next question. If the bar-code scanner didn't work, then the contestants could manually input the answer code. An alarm
is sounded at the end of the time limit.


The contestant would start off with random easy questions (the ones prefixed with 'e'), then medium ('m') and then hard ('h').


Here are the question codes and the answers. Not so sure about the answers since they were changed at the last minute, but most of 
these should work.
